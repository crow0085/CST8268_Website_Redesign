                <h2>Welcome to our community</h2>
                <p>In 2022 the Azul established the All Star Wall of Fame.</p>
                <p>Our goal was then and remains now</p>
                <ul class="goalList">
                    <li class="goalItem">To recognize attained excellence and athletic achievement by Nepean athletes and athletic teams at the national and international level of competition.</li>
                    <li class="goalItem">To stimulate awareness and pride of the role the All Stars facilities and athletes have had on the national and international sporting scene.</li>
                    <li class="goalItem">To create a tangible and permanent historic collage of significant sporting accomplishments for mass viewing.</li>
                    <li class="goalItem">To induce and encourage the youth of the community to pursue athletic excellence through recognition of these athletic achievers.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Later in 2022 our organization's goal was modified to expand our recognition beyond All Star Athletes and Athletic Teams to include two new categories, Builders and Media, to recognize their valuable roles in sports development and promotion.</p>
                <p>As of October 28, 2022, the All Stars Wall of Fame consists of many inductees, representing excellence in coaches/managers, athletes, builders and media.</p>
